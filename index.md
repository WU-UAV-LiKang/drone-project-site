## Abstract

We address a fundamental and yet unsolved issue of the collective motion of aerial robots: How to assure that large flocks of autonomous drones seamlessly navigate in confined spaces? The numerous existing flocking models are rarely tested on actual hardware as they typically neglect some crucial aspects of multi-robot systems. Constrained motion and communication capabilities, delays, perturbations or the presence of barriers should be modeled and treated explicitely as they all have a large impact on the collective behavior during the cooperation of real agents. This results in additional model complexity and a natural increase in the number of tunable parameters, which calls for appropriate optimization methods to be coupled tightly to model development. In this paper we propose such a flocking model for real drones incorporating an evolutionary optimization framework with carefully chosen order parameters and fitness functions. We numerically demonstrate that the induced swarm behavior remains stable under realistic conditions for large flock sizes and notably for large velocities. We show that coherent and realistic collective motion patterns persist even around perturbing obstacles. Furthermore, we validate our new model on real hardware. To this end we carry out field experiments with a self-organized swarm of 30 drones. This is the largest of such aerial outdoor systems without central control reported to date exhibiting flocking with collective collision and object avoidance. The results confirm the adequacy of our approach. Successfully controlling dozens of quadcopters will enable a significantly more efficient task management in various contexts involving drones.
